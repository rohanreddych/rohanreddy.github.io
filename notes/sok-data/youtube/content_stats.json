I know you have to worry about people with low end since you guys are well known for not consuming unnecessary resources, but if there is a prompt, it won&#39;t be a problem right?<br /><br />- revamp discover UI, it does its job but the UI isn&#39;t very good for finding new apps or visually pleasing, if you are gonna do it some day, make it the sexiest appstore linux has to offer because you can do it, you guys are freakin talented.<br /><br />- too many layers to small settings. That&#39;s really annoying when you are trying to theme KDE and theres so many settings that are like option within option within option within option then parameters. (This is something I believe is challenging since it requires redesigning settings hierarchy, but I believe KDE needs to do that, its lot of work for small changes (did I just complained on your behalf lol) )<br /><br />Edit : just saw Gustavo part.<br />Respect for the guy \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f F my man, may your rest in peace.
