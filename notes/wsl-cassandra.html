    <h1>Cassandra on WSL</h1>
    <div>Hello, this is article is the first of a series of articles on how to install various softwares and
        troubleshooting in WSL2. WSL
        is short for Windows Subsystem for Linux. The main attraction of WSL to me was they shared the same file system
        which makes it easier to access a file than switching on a virtual machine which consume a lot of space and are slow. </div>

        <div>In this article, we will see how to install <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>  on WSL2.</div>
