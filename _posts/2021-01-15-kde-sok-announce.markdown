Hello!!,
I am Rohan. I am participating in this year's Season Of KDE. I will be working with the KDE promo team in building an automated data collection and analytics platform. I will be under the mentorship of Paul Brown. Excited about the broad range of the project. That's all for now.

Hopefully, the next time I write things will be more interesting.
